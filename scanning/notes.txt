1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical jargon) of each problem
in no more than 100 words.

Problem 1 (Multiline Comment): I added the ability for the scanner to recognize and properly handle multiline comments. This involved making sure that any text enclosed between /* and */ is ignored by the scanner, which allows the parser to focus only on the relevant code elements.

Problem 2 (Reserved Words): Expanded the scanner's reserved words list to include additional keywords essential for the j-- language. Making sure that these words are correctly identified and differentiated from user-defined identifiers during the scanning process.

Problem 3 (Operators): I improved the scanner to identify different operators like +=, -=, ==, and others. Making sure that mathematical and logical operations are correctly interpreted during compilation.

Problem 4 (Literals): I added support for long and double numbers. This involved handling numbers with suffixes like L or D, as well as managing decimal points and exponents to accurately recognize these types of literals.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, course staff, other), and
the nature of help received.

Name                   Status           Help Received
----                   ------           -------------

...                    ...              ...

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from
doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed doing it.

Working on this assignment was really interesting and taught me a lot about how compilers work. I enjoyed figuring out how to handle different types of numbers and making sure the scanner correctly identifies everything. It was a bit challenging at times, especially with the double literals but i was able to figure it out.
